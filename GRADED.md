Presentation: 15/15

Repository: 15/15

Functionality: 10/15
- project suspiciously resembles 3 hour web development final exam with only a slight tweak. this was not mentioned in any documentation and no communcation was received to this effect. I would expect a lot more functionality from a 6 person team.
- additional functionaltiy very simple and provided little to no extra functionality.

Organization: 15/15

Methodology: 10/15
- repository shows 9 total days worth of commits. these should be spread out as the idea is to incrementally work on the project.
- many very large commits with giant portions of functionality.  again, should be spread out and incremental. show much was built outside of the process.
- all planning in project section of github was completed on one day. again, this should be completed as you complete the tasks in the project.

Code: 8/10
- code lacking internal documentation

Documents: 15/15
